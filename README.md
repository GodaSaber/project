The project about data analysis using excel.
I use in this project Adidus Sales to perform this analysis
First i clean the data from any blank or null value
I remove duplicated values in this data and the data is ready for analysis
second I do analysis on the data using different ways and tables to extract the important information
I try to find the relationship between the columns to get useful information
Third,the visualization of the data using different charts to show this in the images and charts
The end,the dash board is done.
